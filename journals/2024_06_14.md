- Proving viability of Propagators + Virtual DOM was a an exciting goal. I already had a very [rough draft of propagators in observable](https://observablehq.com/@gozala/propagators) and history with Virtual DOM.
	- Back in a day I ported one from [[Elm]] that was used in [[Reflex]] library
	- I also had made [[dominion]] designed to run in worker thread
- While revisiting some of the prior work in new context was very tempting I have resisted the urge and simply published Virtual DOM from Reflex library as a [co-dom](https://github.com/Gozala/co-dom) package
- Figuring out how to expose this in a propagators settings proved more challenging than I have anticipated, but this is roughly what I have settled on
