- I wanted to create a test case for the propagators that illustrated [[diamond graph]] evaluation problem that FRP style libraries need to handle
  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
  A((A))
  B((B))
  C((C))
  D((D))
  A+1[A + 1 = B]
  2*A[A * 2 = C]
  B+C[B + C = D]
  
  A --> A+1 --> B
  A --> 2*A --> C
  B --> B+C
  C --> B+C --> D
  ```
- To my surprise problem did not occur, as it turns out, because scheduler would schedule `A + 1 = B` and `A * 2 = C` propagators when `A` changed, then both would schedule `B + C = D`. However second attempt would be redundant as propagator was already scheduled and `B + C = D` would be scheduled after `A + 1 = B` and `A * 2 = C` so things would propagate properly.
- Which lead me to
