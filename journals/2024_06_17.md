- I wanted to create a test case for the propagators that illustrated [[diamond graph]] evaluation problem that FRP style libraries need to handle
  
  ```js
  flowchart TB
  A((A))
  B((B))
  C((C))
  D((D))
  
  A+1[A + 1 = B]
  2*A[A * 2 = C]
  C+2[C + 2 = D]
  B+D[B + D = E]
  
  A -→ A+1 -→ B
  A -→ 2*A -→ C
  B -→ B+D
  C -→ B+D -→ D
  ```
