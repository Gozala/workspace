- I wanted to create a test case for the propagators that illustrated [[diamond graph]] evaluation problem that FRP style libraries need to handle
  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
  A((A))
  B((B))
  C((C))
  D((D))
  A+1[A + 1 = B]
  2*A[A * 2 = C]
  B+D[B + D = E]
  
  A --> A+1 --> B
  A --> 2*A --> C
  B --> B+D
  C --> B+D --> D
  ```
- To my surprise propblem
