- I wanted to create a test case for the propagators that illustrated [[diamond graph]] evaluation problem that FRP style libraries need to handle
  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
  A((A))
  B((B))
  C((C))
  D((D))
  A+1[A + 1 = B]
  2*A[A * 2 = C]
  B+C[B + C = D]
  
  A --> A+1 --> B
  A --> 2*A --> C
  B --> B+C
  C --> B+C --> D
  ```
- To my surprise problem did not occur, as it turns out, because scheduler would schedule `A + 1 = B` and `A * 2 = C` propagators when `A` changed, then both would schedule `B + C = D`. However second attempt would be redundant as propagator was already scheduled and `B + C = D` would be scheduled after `A + 1 = B` and `A * 2 = C` so things would propagate properly.
- Which lead me to complicating a diamond slightly so that bottom propagator would run for both left and right branch. I had to simply introduce extra step in the right branch so that it would be scheduled as opposed to joining propagator
  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
  A((A))
  B((B))
  C((C))
  D((D))
  E((E))
  A+1[A + 1 = B]
  2*A[A * 2 = C]
  C+2[C + 2 = D]
  B+D[B + D = E]
  
  A --> A+1 --> B
  A --> 2*A --> C
  C --> C+2 --> D
  B --> B+D
  D --> B+D --> E
  ```
- As expected this above graph exhibited the problem and `E` cell got updated twice once when new `B` and stale `D` got propagated and second when `D` caught up.
- ## Avoiding recomputation by tracking dependencies
  
  Now it was time to try a solution alluded to by [[Propagation Networks]] dissertation and capture input times of data sources as it propagates through the network. In essence in `B + D = E` would would be able to see what **shared** inputs are `B` and `D` propagated from and whether they are from the same time. If times do not align one of the cells is stale, in which case we don't propagate until cells catch up. If there are no shared inputs we can safely propagate as it won't lead to inconsistent state.
- As with everything else in propagators you have to model this using data types that propagate, and describe how new information arriving is merged into it. I was limited by time so I chose to do a very naive implementation as a prove of concept. General idea was to model data as `{value: T, cause: Record<string, number> }` tuple where `cause` is a mapping of input source `name â†’ version`
  
  ```ts
  class Because {
    constructor(value, cause) {
      this.value = value;
      this.cause = cause;
    }
    static ["+"] = Propagator.from({
      input: { x: {}, y: {} },
      output: { z: {} },
      step: ({ x, y }) => {
        // Only propagate `z` if `x` and `y` inputs are aligned on versions
        if (Because.consistent(x, y)) {
          const z = new Because(x.valueOf() + y.valueOf(), {
            ...x.cause,
            ...y.cause
          });
  
          return { z }
        } 
        // Otherwise do not propagate anything
        else {
          return {}
        }
      }
    })
  
    // This is very simple version to simply prove the general concept
    static consistent(left, right) {
      for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(left.cause)) {
        const expect = right?.cause?.[key] ?? value;
        if (expect != value) {
          return false;
        }
      }
      return true;
    }
  
    // Last write wins
    merge(increment) {
      return { ok: increment };
    }
    valueOf() {
      return this.value;
    }
  }
  ```
- This naive implementation proved the concept and prevented stale data propagation, so in next iteration we can device a proper implementation.
