- Random thoughts on the data & storage
	- Inputs bound to the [[recipe]] may change during it's execution session, however with on-demand reads data could appear incoherent. Most likely we'd want to version data and capture version at the start of the execution so that on-demand reads could be performed against that version.
		- It is likely that some sessions may wish to react to input changes and (partially) re-evaluate, however even then evaluating against a coherent version seems desired.
		- This reminds me of how in Alexey Radul disertation [“Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation”](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/49525/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2009-053.pdf), "dependency directed backtracking" is used to decide whether to propagate computation further or to wait for next update so that all inputs are coherent (have no contradictions)
		- This makes me think that composite hierarchical data akin of [JSON pointers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) is going to introduce complexity
