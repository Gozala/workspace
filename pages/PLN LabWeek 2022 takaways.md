- There is a clear interest in the network to have better way to replicate data on remote nodes than current [IPFS pinning service API](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/)
	- [[Iroh]] is calling it a cashing API
	- Stewards seem to recognize the value of allowing delegations and UCANs based tokens that do not need to be kept secret.
	- Fission never liked pinning but they do would love a way to replicate data in highly available nodes.
	- Lot of people seem hesitant to choose web3.storage API over the api with a specification, compatibility tests and list of vendors implementing it.
	- Idea of having writable gateways that could route to storage provider seems to appeal to everyone I talked to.
	- I think there is an opportunity to [propose a specification](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/) so that [[Iroh]], [[Fission]] and perhaps others could implement. After which we could claim that we have a better standard API for storing/replicating DAGs in remote nodes.
