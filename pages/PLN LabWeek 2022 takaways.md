- There is a clear interest in the network to have better way to replicate data on remote nodes than current [IPFS pinning service API](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/)
	- [[Iroh]] is calling it a cashing API
	- Stewards seem to recognize the value of allowing delegations and UCANs based tokens that do not need to be kept secret.
	- Fission never liked pinning but they do would love a way to replicate data in highly available nodes.
	- Lot of people seem hesitant to choose web3.storage API over the api with a specification, compatibility tests and list of vendors implementing it.
	- Idea of having writable gateways that could route to storage provider seems to appeal to everyone I talked to.
	- I think there is an opportunity to [propose a specification](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/) so that [[Iroh]], [[Fission]] and perhaps others could implement. After which we could claim that we have a better standard API for storing/replicating DAGs in remote nodes.
- It seemed like everyone was excited about UCANs. Ability to delegate [[IPNS]] publish seems to resonate both with stewards and anyone using IPNS today.
	- I have discussed idea of proposing new [[IPNS]] spec that is [[UCAN]] based with [[@lidel]], [[Iroh]] team and Fission & everyone seems to be onboard.
	- I think we should take a lead and author [[IPIP]] proposal that would define IPNS protocol with [[UCAN]] based authorization.
- UCANs delegating to email address using DKIM proofs seems to address a lot of usability problems and brief discussion of how we could approach that within UCANs seemed to resonate with ucan-wg members that were present there.
	- I have already started writing up [[ucan-mailto]] spec, and I think we should get it across the finish line as fast as we can.
- IPNS with email as keys is a synthesis of the [[ucan-mailto]] and [[ucan-ipns]] ideas that could make huge impact on overall mutability story in IPFS.
	- I got positive feedback from [[Iroh]] team, who would be interested in implementing support for this.
	- Fission is obviously interested in this as well.
	- If we propose spec and three different orgs committed to supporting it we'll be the majority of IPFS implementations supporting it.
	- [[@thibmeu]] from Cloudflare also expressed some interest in the idea, but with some caveats
- [[@thibmeu]] from Cloudflare seemed to think that IPNS is simply reinventing DNS and there is a value to just adopting DNS protocol instead.
	- I don't know enough about DNS to assess what he was describing, but I encouraged him to start [[IPIP]] proposal.
	- After some discussion I was able to confirm that [[ipns-mailto]] could be complimentary with IPNS over DNS and not competing appoach.
	- I think it would be a good idea to collaborate with [[@thibmeu]] on this so we can have something where DHT would not be a bottleneck.
- [[@achingbrain]] fixed bunch of [[DHT]] related problems in js-ipfs and we may be able to use leverage it soon.
	- It does look like however that [[DHT]] and serverless architecture are fundamentally incompatible, so we'd still need long running process around.
- I had a chance to catchup with [[eod]] in regards to reconciling UCAN x CACAO differences.
	- We both agreed that there is enough overlap today that it would be silly not to share an IPLD data model.
	- He captured some feedback on the latest [[UCAN-IPLD]] and what we still need to address to implement compatibility https://gist.github.com/oed/cbb76aa60f919bddfafe5ff879f3dfe8
- In the IPLD planning session I have raised idea of forming a working group which seems to work very well in case of [[UCAN-WG]]
	- [[@rangermauve]] is leading an effort to form WG and asked us participate / represent dag.house
		- https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/249
- CIDv2 / fat pointers / application effort
	- Lot of interesting discussions occured around this idea that has many different names.
	- [[@vmx]] started an [effort to reconcile those](https://hackmd.io/@vmx/HkoYAr64o)
	- Major breakthrough seems to be reframing a problem from something very abstract or very concrete into something that seems to capture general idea without prescribing semantics. We do not have consensus on name, however I like calling it an "application" that is application of specific semantics (identified by CID) onto some data (also identified by the CID).
		- In some cases that is invocation of WASM code with some IPLD data.
		- In other cases it's hashing with specific parameters.
		- In other cases it could be a schema / type invariant on some IPLD data.
	- There was discussion with Fission, IPVM, [[@vmx]] and myself in an attempt to reconcile differences. I think we succeeded to some degree and settled on idea that "application" should:
		- Have IPLD node representation with a new codec.
		- Representation should be a multiformat that essentially packs two CIDs.
		- There should be an unambiguous way to refer to both "application" itself and a "result of the application"
		- [[@mikeal]]'s idea of using identity hash as a means of encoding this was not popular and trouble with such approach in [[IPVM]] had been brought up.
		- I personally thought we need separate construct for representing "application" in IPLD schema that is not `Link` but is rather `Application`, but that did not prove popular either.
			- Arguments were made that application should just be a block and it's up to interpreter to decide what to do with it ()I'm probably butchering it)
		- There seemed to be consensus that application should be limited to a single CID as opposed to multiple. If you want it over multiple CIDs just pack them in tuple.
		- There was a call to form a working group around this as well. I believe [[@vmx]] volunteered to  lead this effort.
- [[Move the bytes WG]]
	- [[@b5]]  from [[Iroh]] team started a community effort to form a move the bytes WG, with a goal of  better transport protocol than bitswap.
	- Approach is to collect user stories & create test infrastructure and finally identify specific implementation efforts that would improve the current status quo.
	- dag.house team participated in ideation process.
	- We've committed to participate in the WG.
	- We have identified opportunity in making put bytes here & take bytes from there part of the protocol.
		- It allows us to reduce operational costs.
		- It also seems to fit well with IPFS in my pocket scenarios as attested by [[@carsonfarmer]] (of Textile fame), because you may not have requested bytes locally but often have them somewhere in the cloud.
- [[Web Native FileSystem]] support in web3.storage
	- Fission really wants us to support [[WNFS]] on our gateways
	- Doing it through [[autocodec]] seems to be desired approach
	- Currently we can not dynamically load WASM in cloudflare workers, however we could prebundle [[WNFS]] codec in order to support it.
- [[Autocodec]] is gaining momentum and [[Fission]] is working towards MVP.
	- It solves many problems, but loading WASM in CF workers is a roadblock
	- Someone (can't remember who) overheard [[@thibmeu]] saying that lack of dynamic WASM loading in workers is not intentional constraint, but rather something that had not been done yet due to some V8 complexities.
		- Apparently Fastly supports [dynamic WASM loading](https://docs.fastly.com/products/compute-at-edge) which in turn pressures CF to fix this limination.
	- We should raise the subject with CF to see how visible dynamic loading would be and on what timeline.
	- I also have discussed with [[@expede]] idea of doing WASM on the client side instead.
		- Broadly speaking service worker could load WASM and do all the processing
		- There are some unknown however in regards to first load experience, because some page would need to install service worker first.
- Vision of [[Iroh]] seems to align with
