- There is a clear interest in the network to have better way to replicate data on remote nodes than current [IPFS pinning service API](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/)
	- [[Iroh]] is calling it a cashing API
	- Stewards seem to recognize the value of allowing delegations and UCANs based tokens that do not need to be kept secret.
	- Fission never liked pinning but they do would love a way to replicate data in highly available nodes.
	- Lot of people seem hesitant to choose web3.storage API over the api with a specification, compatibility tests and list of vendors implementing it.
	- Idea of having writable gateways that could route to storage provider seems to appeal to everyone I talked to.
	- I think there is an opportunity to [propose a specification](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/) so that [[Iroh]], [[Fission]] and perhaps others could implement. After which we could claim that we have a better standard API for storing/replicating DAGs in remote nodes.
- It seemed like everyone was excited about UCANs. Ability to delegate [[IPNS]] publish seems to resonate both with stewards and anyone using IPNS today.
	- I have discussed idea of proposing new [[IPNS]] spec that is [[UCAN]] based with [[@lidel]], [[Iroh]] team and Fission & everyone seems to be onboard.
	- I think we should take a lead and author [[IPIP]] proposal that would define IPNS protocol with [[UCAN]] based authorization.
- UCANs delegating to email address using DKIM proofs seems to address a lot of usability problems and brief discussion of how we could approach that within UCANs seemed to resonate with ucan-wg members that were present there.
	- I have already started writing up [[ucan-mailto]] spec, and I think we should get it across the finish line as fast as we can.
- IPNS with email as keys is a synthesis of the [[ucan-mailto]] and [[ucan-ipns]] ideas that could make huge impact on overall mutability story in IPFS.
	- I got positive feedback from [[Iroh]] team, who would be interested in implementing support for this.
	- Fission is obviously interested in this as well.
	- If we propose spec and three different orgs committed to supporting it we'll be the majority of IPFS implementations supporting it.
	- [[@thibmeu]] from Cloudflare also expressed some interest in the idea, but with some caveats
- [[@thibmeu]] from Cloudflare seemed to think that IPNS is simply reinventing DNS and there is a value to just adopting DNS protocol instead.
	- I don't know enough about DNS to assess what he was describing, but I encouraged him to start [[IPIP]] proposal.
	- After some discussion I was able to confirm that [[ipns-mailto]] could be complimentary with IPNS over DNS and not competing appoach.
	- I think it would be a good idea to collaborate with [[@thibmeu]] on this so we can have something where DHT would not be a bottleneck.
- [[@achingbrain]] fixed bunch of [[DHT]] related problems in js-ipfs and we may be able to use leverage it soon.
	- It does look like however that [[DHT]] and serverless architecture are fundamentally incompatible, so we'd still need long running process around.
- I had a chance to catchup with [[eod]] regarding UCAN x CACAO
