title::  Decision graphs but decentralized
reply-to:: https://purrfect-tracker-45c.notion.site/decision-graphs-3be78b22e8d64d1fbae7b9d066ef6c25

- I really like idea of capturing decision graphs so they don't end up lost in an ephemeral threads of popular platform of today. In fact that is also why I'm hesitant towards capturing them in [[Notion]], which is popular platform today with bells and whistles allowing to link aÂ cross pieces of information within it. Don't get me wrong it has great features and standardized tooling is great, yet I don't feel like I own the thoughts I've put in there and it does deprives collaborators from choice. In fact the way comments in notion work seem to be at adds with view described in [[decision graphs]]
- I would prefer an open protocol for forming and linking [[decision graphs]], which is more along the lines of [[indieweb reply]] than it is interlinked notion pages.
- I will also try write up my thoughts on the decisions I make and the things I want to communicate in [[LogSeq]] and publish them on the web  so they can be linked to.
