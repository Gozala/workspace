On blockchain you can transfer funds from your account to anyone else's. In hindsight it is obvious, our services should allow anyone to transfer funds from their credit card to any [[did:key]].

- This approach means we don't need to care who is funding an account nor account holder needs to get a credit card info from the donor, all they need is publish account DID and ask donors to fund it.
- This also means opens up opportunities to create more interesting funding models. If I need to create application specific scope, I could create a new account for it and fund it through my primary account with funds. So it does start to feel more like blockchain as you can move funds between various accounts programmatically.
