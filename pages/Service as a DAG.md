- [Lack of functions](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/263) in [[IPLD Schema]] motivates workarounds in order to describe web3.storage protocol in terms of it. I have pretty much submitted to defining functions as structs like
  
  ```ipldsch
  type Protocol {
    DID: Space
  }
  
  type Space struct {
    store Store
    upload Upload
  }
  
  type Store {
    add StoreAdd
    remove StoreRemove
    list StoreList
  }
  
  type Upload {
   add UploadAdd
   remove UploadRemove
   list UploadList
  }
  
  type StoreAdd struct {
    link &CAR
    size Int
    origin optional &CAR
  }
  
  
  ```
