- Provider DID is a short lived [[did:key]] identifier used as an address for a service actor. You can think of service as a rotating pool of (service) providers which come and go as needed.
- Idea is that agents will delegate [[UCAN Invocation]]s to [[Service DID]], which are then executed by specific [[Provider DID]]
