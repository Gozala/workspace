  > In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), **homoiconicity** (from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) words *homo-* meaning "the same" and *icon* meaning "representation") is a property of some [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language). A language is **homoiconic**
   if a program written in it can be manipulated as data using the 
  language, and thus the program's internal representation can be inferred
   just by reading the program itself.  This property is often summarized 
  by saying that the language treats "code as data".
