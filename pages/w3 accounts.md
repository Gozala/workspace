title:: w3 accounts

- As outlined in [w3-accounts](https://hackmd.io/@gozala/w3-accounts) we've been thinking about accounts through web2 lens. This ends up conflating notion of user with an account. However in our system we do not need to identify or track users, in fact with power of delegated [[UCAN]]s we can hardly know
	- time actors with delegated capabilities would add content which will be associated / billed to some account and those actors may be run by:
	- Different agents *(client applications)* run by the same or different people *(because person could just delegate capability to upload to their friends)*
	- Different services may be granted permissions to also upload
