- In dag.house we would like to differentiate between [[Service DID]] and [[Provider DID]].
- We would like to use hardware keys for [[Service DID]]s.
- We would like to never rotate [[Service DID]]s as that would require updating all the agents.
- We would like [[Service DID]] to authorize [[Provider DID]] to execute tasks on it's behalf.
- We would like to rotate [[Provider DID]]s on regular bases and pretty frequently.
- We want agents to delegate [[UCAN invocation]]s to [[Service DID]] and not to [[Provider DID]] as later can be rotate by the time it is executed.
- However UCANs do not support such indirection
	- We did entertain idea of embedding some [[DID routing]] info into UCANS
	- In theory we could use [[did:dns]] or [[did:web]] methods but they introduce additional IO step space for concurrency issues. Furthermore when validating old transactions it would be impossible to tell if [[did:key]] used to be associated with at the time of transaction or not.
	- Alternatively we could embed DID document itself, but then how do we verify that it's not a fake document.
- Another alternative could be to have short lived [[Service DID]]s that could be resolved by agent on every sessions e.g. from domain name.
	- ðŸ’” This introduces hidden complexity from having to do IO to possible race conditions on rotation. Furthermore it creates various attacks possible that would not be possible if resolving [[did:key]]s were not needed.
		- Not that if we had to sign key rotation updates there would be little benefit to rotating keys
